PREDICTION OF IRIS FLOWER(TASK-4)

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict iris flower based on the sepal and petal measurements with the help of machine learning models.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website, and it has a total of 150 Iris flowers

PROJECT SUMMARY

The project can be briefly summarized in the following steps:

* Data understanding: Here, we need to load the data and understand the features in it. This would help us choose the features and targets that we will need for the model.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: In this step, we need to perform data analysis and, if needed, feature modifications. checking and observing the distribution of classes and correlation in the data.

* Train/Test Split: We know the train/test split, which we can perform to check the performance of our models with unseen data.

* Model Creation/Building: This is the step at which we can try different models until we get the desired level of performance on the given dataset. We should try and see if we get a better model by various models. We used K-Nearest neighbor, Randomforest classifer and logistic regression models.

* Model Evaluation: We need to evaluate the model using appropriate evaluation metrics. In this project, we took accuracy.

RESULT

Compared with the other models, Logistic regressor and KNeighborsClassifier gave more accuracy with 97%
